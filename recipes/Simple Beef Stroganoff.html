        At the same time, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring

        Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed soup and
        garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in
        sour cream and season with salt and pepper.
